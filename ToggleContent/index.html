      <h2>Software Development Project (SDP)</h2>
      <li>Given that Software Engineering is built upon the foundations of Computer Science as well as 
        Computer Engineering, a Software Engineering curriculum can be focused on two perspectives - a 
        Computer Science-first or Software Engineering-first perspective. Software engineering spans the 
        entire software lifecycle. It involves creating high-quality and reliable programs in a systematic, 
        controlled, and efficient manner using formal methods for specification, analysis, design and 
        evaluation of proposed systems. </li>
        <li>It requires suitable software development techniques and processes 
            that successfully scale to large applications, which should satisfy timing, size, and security 
            requirements all within acceptable application/project budgets and deadlines. For these reasons, 
            Software Engineering requires both the analytical and descriptive tools and techniques developed in 
            Computer Science and the rigor that the Computer Engineering discipline brings to the reliability and 
            trustworthiness of the systems that software developers design and implement, while working as a 
            cohesive team.</li>

      <h2>Engineering Designing and Development (EDI)</h2>
      <li>Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in areas 
        of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched with 
        semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve socially 
        relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially relevant 
        domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy and 
        Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan.</li><li> To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select 
        relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under guidance of faculty and 
        enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project centric learning. Modern 
        world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are 
        prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active 
        learning and inquiry-based learning.</li><li>Project centric learning will also redefine the role of teacher as 
        mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question,
        challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know, 
        understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze, design and apply categories of Bloomâ€™s 
        Taxonomy</li>

    <div id="dt" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>Design Thinking (DT)</h2>
      <p>The student will be able to</p>
        <li> Understand the importance of doing Research</li>
        <li> Interpret and distinguish different fundamental terms related to Research</li>
        <li> Apply the methodology of doing research and mode of its publication</li>
        <li> Write a Research Paper based on project work</li>
        <li> Understand Intellectual property rights</li>
        <li> Use the concepts of Ethics in Research</li>
        <li> Understand the Entrepreneurship and Business Planning</li>

    <div id="courseProjects" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h2>Course Projects</h2>
      <li>Course projects play a pivotal role in the educational landscape, offering a multifaceted relevance that extends beyond the mere completion of assignments.
         These projects serve as a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical application, granting students the opportunity to apply what they've learned in a tangible, real-world context. 
         This experiential learning process reinforces their understanding of subject matter and helps them appreciate its relevance in practical scenarios. 
         Moreover, course projects stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving skills, often presenting students with complex challenges that demand creative solutions. 
         These projects encourage students to think beyond the confines of their textbooks and embrace a multidisciplinary approach, demonstrating how different areas of study intersect and providing a more holistic understanding of the subject.</li>

        <li>Collaborative aspects of these projects promote teamwork and communication skills, preparing students for the dynamics of professional work environments. Research, data collection, and analysis are often integral components, helping students develop valuable information literacy skills that extend beyond the classroom. 
        Additionally, projects typically culminate in presentations or reports, fostering the development of effective presentation and communication abilities, which are invaluable in academic and professional settings.</li>
        
        <li> Projects can simulate real-world problems, giving students insight into the practical applications of their knowledge and preparing them for future challenges. 
        They serve as a robust form of assessment, allowing instructors to gauge a student's grasp of the subject and their ability to apply their learning in a comprehensive manner.
         Furthermore, long-term projects encourage students to manage their time effectively and develop project management skills, promoting sustained, deep learning and knowledge retention.</li> 
         <li> Projects can be tailored to individual interests or career goals, making learning more personalized and relevant to students' future aspirations. 
         In essence, course projects are a cornerstone of education, encompassing a wide array of skills and experiences that foster a well-rounded, real-world understanding of a subject.</li>
